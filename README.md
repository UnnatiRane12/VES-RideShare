## 📖 About the Project  

Students from various VES colleges often struggle with daily commuting due to limited availability of autos and cabs, high individual travel costs, and poor coordination through large WhatsApp groups. Important messages frequently get lost, making it difficult to find reliable ride partners.  

VES RideShare solves this problem by offering a structured ride-sharing system where only verified VES students can create or join ride rooms. This ensures better coordination, improved safety, and cost-effective travel for the student community.

## 🛠️ Technology Used  

The application is powered by Firebase, which handles user authentication, data storage, and web hosting. Firebase Authentication ensures that only VES students can access the platform, while Cloud Firestore securely stores user profiles and ride information. Firebase App Hosting is used to deploy and manage the web application.  

To improve user experience, Google AI via Genkit is integrated into the system. The Gemini AI model understands natural language input on the “Create a Ride” page and automatically fills in ride details such as route and passenger count, making the process faster and more convenient.
