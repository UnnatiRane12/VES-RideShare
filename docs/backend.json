    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to support the VES RideShare application, focusing on user authentication, sharing room management, and smart matching of users for ride-sharing. Authorization Independence is achieved by storing the `ownerId` within each `SharingRoom` document. This avoids the need for `get()` calls in security rules to verify ownership, enabling atomic operations. Structural Segregation is applied by storing user data in a private collection (`/users/{userId}`), while sharing rooms are stored in a separate collection (`/sharingRooms/{sharingRoomId}`), allowing for distinct security rules for each.\n\nThe structure supports required QAPs (Queries and Permissions) as follows:\n\n*   **List Sharing Rooms:** Listing is supported on the `/sharingRooms` collection.\n*   **Authorization:** Access to a sharing room will be granted to any authenticated user.\n*   **User Data Privacy:**  User documents are private, accessible only to the authenticated user."
