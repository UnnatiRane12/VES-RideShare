/**
 * This Firestore Security Ruleset implements a hybrid security model tailored for the VES RideShare application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The rules enforce a strict user-ownership model for private data while enabling a collaborative, public-facing model for shared data. The default security posture is to deny all access unless explicitly granted. All operations require user authentication.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user profile data. Each user has exclusive control over their own document.
 * - /rideSharingRooms/{roomId}: A top-level collection for ride-sharing rooms. These are publicly discoverable to encourage participation.
 * - /users/{userId}/rideHistory/{rideHistoryId}: A private subcollection containing a user's past ride information, accessible only to that user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Privacy: Listing users from the top-level `/users` collection is strictly forbidden to protect user privacy.
 * - Public Discovery vs. Controlled Writes: Ride sharing rooms are publicly readable and listable, allowing any user to find a ride. However, creation is restricted to authenticated users, and deletion is restricted to the room's original owner. Updates are allowed by any signed-in user to facilitate joining a room, but the room's ownership (`ownerId`) is immutable.
 * - Private Subcollections: A user's ride history is nested under their own user document, ensuring that path-based security rules can easily and efficiently restrict all access to the data owner.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * This ruleset relies on denormalized fields for efficient and secure authorization. The `rideSharingRooms` documents contain an `ownerId`, and the `rideHistory` documents contain a `userId`. This avoids costly and slow `get()` calls in rules, ensuring that authorization decisions are fast and based directly on the data being accessed.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * Private user data (profiles, ride history) is structurally separated from public, collaborative data (ride sharing rooms). This segregation simplifies security rules, enhances query performance, and provides a stronger security guarantee than filtering a mixed collection with a "isPublic" flag.
